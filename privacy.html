            <h1>Privacy policy for mobile application "Ithildin"</h1>

            <p>Last updated: April 25, 2022</p>
            <p>
                This privacy policy governs your use of the software application “Ithildin” (later referred as the/this “Application”) for Android and iOS mobile devices that was created by Lúthien Dulk.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Application is a Flutter application intended as a dictionary of the Elvish (and other) languages found in the work of J.R.R. Tolkien, with its contents based on the Eldamo lexicon (https://eldamo.org/).
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h2>

            <h3>User Provided Information</h3>
            <p>
                The Application does in its current version not allow any user registration; therefore  no personal information can be collected.
            </p>
            <p>The only user provided data that this Application uses consists of the preferences regarding search term matching and available language sets, which are stored only locally on your device, within the default configuration file system of Android and iOS. 
            </p>

            <h3>Collected Information</h3>
            <p>The Application does not collect any information.
            </p>
            <p>The Application does not share any information with third parties.
            </p>
            <p>The Application does not collect any information about the location of your mobile device.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Do third parties see and/or have access to information ?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Third parties have no access to any information obtained by the Application, because there isn't any.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>What are my opt-out rights?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can easily delete all User Provided Data by uninstalling the Application from your mobile device. You may use the standard uninstall process of your mobile device. This will delete the settings data.</p>
 
            <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information</h2>
            <p>As stated above, this Application does neither automatically collect, share nor retain any information, nor can it do so manually. Configuration settings are stored locally on your mobile device. Nothing can or will be retained or managed even - and let me stress that - <i>even</i> if you would vehemently wish to do so.
            </p>


            <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Children</h2>
            <p>The Application does not address anyone under the age of 13. From this, and the above, follows that NO personally identifiable information is knowingly collected from anyone under (over / on) the age of 13. Neither is this app used to knowingly solicit data from or market to persons under (over / on) the age of 13. 
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Security</h2>
            <p>We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information stored locally on your mobile device. 
            </p>
            <p>Please be aware that, although we endeavor provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches (e.g., a zero-day attack targeting mobile Operating System – OS).
            </p>
            <p>In order to ensure an optimal security, you should regularly install any Application’s update available from the mobile application marketplace / App Store. 
            </p>
            <p>We also advise you to regularly check for any iOS / Android OS update(s) that could be available and to enable automatic updates.
            </p>


            <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Changes</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy at <a href="https://animatrice.nl/ithildin/privacy.html">"https://animatrice.nl/ithildin/privacy.html</a> and update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>Please be aware that, although we endeavor provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches (e.g., a zero-day attack targeting mobile Operating System – OS).
            </p>
            <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page. 
            </p>



            <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Your Consent</h2>
            <p>By using the Application, you only consent to local processing of your Application configuration.
            </p>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Contact Us</h2>
            <p>Though it seems exceedingly unlikely, should you still have any remaining questions  regarding privacy in connection to using the Application, please contact us via email at: <br/> ithildin [at] animatrice [dot] nl
